This repository contains a demo code for testing the deep learning system implemented in the article "Deep learning-based prediction of right ventricular ejection fraction using 2D echocardiograms".

The demo code consits of a preprocessing and a model definition python file, as well as a demo ipython-notebok in which the system can be tested in an iteractive, online interface.
